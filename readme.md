##  Pangaea Backend Take Home For Olalekan Efunkunle

This is my answer for the Pangaea Takehome.


## The environment variable are exposed deliberately in the github file 


## Usage
nmp run start =>> starts the Publisher server

npm run sub =>> starts the Subscribers' server

##  To subscribe:
a post request with the subscribing url and the topic as a parameter is sent to the publishing server.

## To Publish:
a post request with the message the client wants to publish is sent to the publishing server with the topic as a url parameter, and it publishes to all subscribers



All instructions were followed and the app works as expected.
